Problem 2:
a)
i) this will help in having a more smouth values for the updates since now we are not only taking the current gradient
We are also weighing it against all the previous grandients and thus the movement is much smouther.
ii) by dividing by the magnitude, parameters with smaller gradients will get bigger updates and thus it will help in preventing stucking.
b)
i) gamma will be th equal to the inverse of the expected value of d, so it should be 1/(1 - pdrop)
ii) during training it helps in more robustness and regularization. During evaluation we want the full model capabilities.
